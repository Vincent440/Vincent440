Hi my name is Vincent, I usually go by Vince.
I'm currently employed remotely as a teaching assistant at the MSU Coding Boot Camp teaching full stack web development in the [MERN stack](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mern-stack). 
Skilled in full stack web development currently using the MERN/[PERN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pern-stack/) stack and Googling what I need to learn to get the job done. :shrug:
